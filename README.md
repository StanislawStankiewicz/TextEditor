# Text Editor
In this project I tried implementing text edition logic from scratch (starting from drawing each letter, ending with ctrl-z functionality), although I failed because C# turned out to be a too high language for such a basic task for me, I still enjoyed learning a new framework.

## Functionality
This editor accomplishes basic text editor tasks (and looks nicer that pre-Windows 11 Notepad).
